    "\n",
    "This is a simple walkthrough of how to use the `SensitiveWords` validator to check whether an LLM-generated response contains culturally inapporopriate/sensitive words that are now outdated. Such words may appear in the LLM-generated response because they might be present in the training data. These words can be offensive and inappropriate in certain contexts. This validator will detect such words, and replace them with corresponding appropriate words. It is based on a static list of manually curated words and phrases - and hence may not be exhaustive and may not be able to detect all such words.\n"
